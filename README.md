This project is not for public use...

The main idea is to develop something useful for myself and learn golang, having a lot of experience in PHP.

Goal is make DLNA server for Samsung TVs that I own.
When they ask for a description of the device, they introduce themselves as: 

 - User-Agent: SEC_HHP_TV-40C7000/1.0
 - User-Agent: DLNADOC/1.50 SEC_HHP_[TV] Samsung 5 Series (55)/1.0 UPnP/1.0

Both of them support remembering last playback position (bookmarks) and this is what I need in first priority.

My interest only video. Audio and images is not what I want to watch on TV.
I don't need artist, album, genre, description, etc. Only video files stored in folders.

Using bookmarks I'm going to visualize it on video thumbnails -
for example, the bottom bar will be filled with green based on the percentage of views.
