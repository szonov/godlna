# Notice about duration configuration:
# - ssdp.max_age, ssdp.notify_interval, store.cache_life_time
#
# A duration must be as "number<unit>", without any spaces. Valid units are:
#
#        ns         nanoseconds (billionth of a second)
#        us, Âµs     microseconds (millionth of a second)
#        ms         milliseconds (thousands of a second)
#        s          seconds
#        m          minutes
#        h          hours
#
# You can combine multiple units; for example "5m10s" for 5 minutes and 10 seconds.
